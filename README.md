# Text-Summarization
This project implements a robust text summarization tool using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this project is to help generate concise summaries of large text bodies across different file formats, making it adaptable for multiple use cases. Whether you have long research articles, reports, or other documents, this summarization tool can reduce them to a compact form without losing essential information.

Features
->Multi-format support: This tool can handle text data from different file formats, including:
  - Plain text files (.txt)
  - Microsoft Word documents (.docx)
  - PDF files (.pdf)
  The program automatically detects the input format and processes it accordingly to generate accurate summaries.
->Customizable Summarization: You can tweak the summarization length and the level of detail by adjusting key parameters in the code, ensuring the output fits your specific needs.
->Efficient Processing: Built using optimized NLP libraries such as spaCy, Gensim, and NLTK, the summarization tool processes large documents swiftly while maintaining high accuracy.
